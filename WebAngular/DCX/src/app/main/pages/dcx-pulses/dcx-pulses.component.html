            <br>
            <p class="fs-19">The pulses market is forecast to continue to grow, driven by food security agendas
                and the shift away from meat proteins to a plant-based diet. Robust demand for plant-based meat is
                fuelling growth in pulses. Pulses are a sustainable superfood with low carbon and water footprints.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="fs-19">Global pulse consumption reached 92 million tons in 2020 posting 3% annual growth
                in the previous decade. The global trade in pulses grew from 13 million tons to 17 million tons over
                the same period. The OECD-FAO expects consumption to increase to 114 million tons by 2030 and the
                global trade is estimated to exceed 20 million tons by 2030.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="fs-19 mb-5">The market is fragmented, plagued by inefficiencies and a lack of
                transparency. DCX Pulses will connect exporters, importers, traders and third parties, enabling them
                to trade physical pulses across the world efficiently and securely. Once a full marketplace has been
                created, market participants will enjoy price transparency and verifiable pricing data on a
                customizable dashboard.</p>
